# 🔥 Noctis-Multi-Material Heated Enclosure System 
A purpose-built heated enclosure designed for high-temperature, multi-material 3D printing.
This is not a cosmetic shell.
This enclosure is engineered for thermal stability, structural rigidity, and reliable multi-color ASA/engineering-grade material output under sustained chamber heat.

🚀 Overview

     -The Noctis-MMU enclosure was designed to:

     -Maintain elevated chamber temperatures for engineering polymers

     -Support multi-material (MMU) color changes inside a heated environment

     -Keep relative humidity levels low

      -Use PolyDryer to heat the chamber

      -And most of all to be SIMPLE!
